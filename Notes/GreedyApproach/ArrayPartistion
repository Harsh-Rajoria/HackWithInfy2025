Example 1

Input:
nums = [1, 4, 3, 2] Step 1: Sort the array** Sorted: 1,### Step 2: Pair the numbers
Pair 1: (1, 2) → min = 1
Pair 2: (3, 4) → min = 3
Step 3: Sum the minimums
Sum = 1 + 3 = 4
Output: 4
Why not other pairings?
Any other pairing (as shown in your explanation) gives a sum of 3, which is less than 4.

Example 2

Input:
nums = [6, 2, 6, 5, 1, 2] Step 1: Sort the array** Sorted: 1,### Step 2: Pair the numbers
Pair 1: (1, 2) → min = 1
Pair 2: (2, 5) → min = 2
Pair 3: (6, 6) → min = 6
Step 3: Sum the minimums
Sum = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9
Output: 9


Key Takeaways
Sort the array.
Pair consecutive elements.
Sum the first element of each pair (the minimum).
This method guarantees the maximum possible sum of minimums.
