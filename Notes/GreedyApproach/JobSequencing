Greedy Approach
1. Sort jobs by profit (descending):
Always try to schedule the most profitable jobs first.
2. For each job:
Try to schedule it in the latest available slot before its deadline.
3. Use an array for slots:
Each index represents a time slot (1-based for clarity). If a slot is empty, the job can be scheduled there.


1. Sort jobs by profit:
c (profit 40, deadline 1)
d (profit 30, deadline 1)
a (profit 20, deadline 4)
b (profit 10, deadline 1)
2. Maximum deadline: 4
So, slots available: 1, 2, 3, 4
3. Schedule jobs:
Job c: Try slot 1 → available, schedule c at slot 1, profit = 40
Job d: Try slot 1 → already taken, can't schedule
Job a: Try slot 4 → available, schedule a at slot 4, profit = 20 (total = 60)
Job b: Try slot 1 → already taken, can't schedule
4. Total profit: 40 (c) + 20 (a) = 60
