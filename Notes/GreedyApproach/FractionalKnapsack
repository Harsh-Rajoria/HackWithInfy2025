1. Input Reading
Prompts the user to enter the number of items.
For each item, reads its value and weight.
Reads the knapsack's capacity.
2. Sorting
Sorts the items in descending order of their value-to-weight ratio. This ensures the most "valuable" items per unit weight are considered first.
3. Greedy Selection
Iterates through the sorted items:
If the current item fits entirely, add its full value and reduce the remaining capacity.
If not, take as much as possible (a fraction) to fill the knapsack, add the proportional value, and stop.
4. Output
Prints the maximum value that can be obtained, formatted to two decimal places.

How It Works
Value/weight ratios:
Item 1: 60/10 = 6.0
Item 2: 100/20 = 5.0
Item 3: 120/30 = 4.0
Sorted order: Item 1, Item 2, Item 3.
Greedy selection:
Take all of Item 1 (weight 10, value 60). Remaining capacity: 40.
Take all of Item 2 (weight 20, value 100). Remaining capacity: 20.
Take 20/30 of Item 3 (value = 120 * (20/30) = 80). Capacity is now 0.
Total value = 60 + 100 + 80 = 240.00
