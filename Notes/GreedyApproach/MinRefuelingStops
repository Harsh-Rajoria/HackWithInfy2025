1. Input Reading
Reads the target distance and the starting fuel.
Reads the number of gas stations.
Reads each station's distance from the start and the amount of fuel it can provide.
2. Max-Heap (Priority Queue)
Used to always refuel from the station with the most fuel among those passed but not yet used.
3. Main Loop
While the current fuel is less than the target:
Add all stations within reach (whose distance is â‰¤ current fuel) to the heap.
If the heap is empty, you cannot reach the target; print -1 and exit.
Otherwise, refuel with the largest available fuel from the heap, incrementing the stop count.
4. Output
Prints the minimum number of refueling stops needed to reach the target.


Example:

1. Start with 10 fuel, can reach station at 10 (add 60 to heap).
2. Can't reach 20, so refuel with 60 (now fuel = 70, stops = 1).
3. Now can reach stations at 20, 30, 60 (add 30, 30, 40 to heap).
4. To reach 100, need more fuel, so refuel with 40 (now fuel = 110, stops = 2).
5. Now can reach the target.
